## API keys
Smallest AI uses API keys for authentication. You must include your key with every API request to authenticate your identity and track usage against your quota.

Each API key can be scoped to the following:

- **Rate Limits**: Controls the number of requests allowed within a specified time period.
- **Credit Quota**: Defines the maximum usage credits available for your account.

Your API key is confidential and should be kept secure. Never share it with others or expose it in client-side code (browsers, mobile apps, github repositories, etc.).

## Making Requests
All API requests require your key in the `Authorization` header using the Bearer key format:

```
Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY
```

## Example API Request
Test the API with this curl command by replacing `YOUR_API_KEY` with your actual key:

```bash
curl 'https://waves-api.smallest.ai/api/v1/lightning/get_voices' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY'
```

## Example with the Smallest Python Package
<CodeGroup>
```python python
from smallest import Smallest

# Initialize the client with your API key
client = Smallest(api_key="YOUR_API_KEY")

# Retrieve available voices
print(f"Available Voices: {client.get_voices(model='lightning')}")
```
