To get the most accurate and natural voice clone, it's essential to provide **high-quality reference audio**. The best practices for recording remain the same as those for **Instant Voice Cloning**, which you can find here:  

üîó **[Instant Voice Cloning - Best Practices](/v2.2.0/content/best-practices/vc-best-practices)**  

However, **Professional Voice Cloning (PVC) significantly improves upon Instant Voice Cloning** in the following ways:  

## üéôÔ∏è How PVC Enhances Voice Cloning  

### 1. **Handles Background Noise More Effectively**  
   - PVC can filter out mild background noise without affecting voice quality.  
   - Unlike Instant Cloning, **PVC adapts better to real-world recording conditions**.  

### 2. **Captures a More Natural Speaking Style**  
   - Supports a **wider range of tones and vocal inflections**.  
   - Preserves the natural rhythm and personality of speech.  

### 3. **Understands Extreme Emotions & Variability**  
   - PVC models can **learn from expressive speech**, making them ideal for voices with dynamic emotions (anger, excitement, sadness).  
   - Instant Cloning may struggle with highly expressive tones.  

### 4. **Improves Inconsistent Speaking Patterns**  
   - Can learn from **pauses, breath sounds, and fluctuations in speaking speed**.  
   - Works well even if the reference recordings contain slight variations.  

### 5. **More Robust for Long-Form Content**  
   - Best suited for audiobook narration, dubbing, and professional voice applications.  
   - Produces high-quality results even in long recordings.
