# Creating a Professional Voice Clone

1. **Go to the Smallest AI Platform**  
   Navigate to [smallest.ai](https://waves.smallest.ai/voice-clone) and click on **Create New**. In the modal that appears, select **Professional Voice Clone**. This will direct you to the setup page:

2. **Upload Your Audio File**  
   Follow the instructions provided on the page to upload your audio file. Ensure that the recording is clear for the best results.

3. **Enable Denoise (Optional)**  
   If your audio contains background noise, toggle **Denoise** on to improve quality.

4. **Wait for Model to get trained**    
   The voice cloning process typically takes **3 to 6 hours**, but may take longer depending on demand. The Voice Clone will be available to Use on platform and you will also get mail for that. 

### **Note:**  
**Creation of Professional Voice Clones (PVC) is not available via the SDK** due to the requirement of larger audio files. Please use the Smallest AI platform for this process.
