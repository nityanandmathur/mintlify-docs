This comprehensive guide outlines the recommended practices for formatting text to ensure optimal processing, accuracy, and consistent output across different use cases. Following these guidelines will help improve the quality of generated audio and reduce potential errors.

## Language and Script Guidelines

### Mixed Language Formatting

When working with mixed language content, particularly English and Hindi, proper script selection is crucial for accurate processing:

- English text must be written in Latin script
- Hindi text must be written in Devanagari script
- Avoid transliteration of Hindi words into Latin script

**Examples:**
```
✅ Correct: I want to eat खाना
❌ Incorrect: I want to eat khana

✅ Correct: मैं school जाता हूं
❌ Incorrect: main school jata hun
```

### Proper Nouns Handling

For Indian proper nouns, maintain cultural and linguistic accuracy by following these rules:

1. **City Names:**
   - Use Devanagari script for Indian city names
   - Maintain Latin script for non-Indian city names

2. **Personal Names:**
   - Use Devanagari script for Indian personal names
   - Maintain original script for non-Indian names

**Examples:**
```
✅ Correct: I live in मुंबई near अंधेरी station
❌ Incorrect: I live in Mumbai near Andheri station

✅ Correct: Hello! अमित and रोहित are my friends from New York
❌ Incorrect: Hello! Amit and Rohit are my friends from New York

✅ Correct: Hello! मैं दिल्ली में रहता हूं। My name is John and my friend's name is श्याम।
❌ Incorrect: Hello! Mai Delhi me rehta hun. My name is John and my friend's name is Shyam.
```

## Text Chunking

### Character Limit Guidelines

To optimize real-time processing and reduce latency, implement these chunking practices:

1. **Size Constraints:**
   - Maximum chunk size: 250 characters
   - Break at natural punctuation points
   - Maintain sentence coherence when possible

2. **Breaking Points Priority:**
   - First priority: Sentence-ending punctuation (., !, ?)
   - Second priority: Other punctuation (;, :)
   - Third priority: Natural word breaks

### Chunking Implementation

Use the following Python code for implementing text chunking:
- For `lightning-large` model, set `max_chunk_size=140`.
- For `lightning` model, set `max_chunk_size=250`. 

<CodeGroup>
```python python
def chunk_text(text, max_chunk_size=250):
    """
    Chunks text with a maximum size of 250 characters, preferring to break at punctuation marks.

    - For `lightning-large` model, set `max_chunk_size=140`.
    - For `lightning` model, set `max_chunk_size=250`. 
    
    Args:
        text (str): Input text to be chunked
        max_chunk_size (int): Maximum size of each chunk (default: 250)
        
    Returns:
        list: List of text chunks
    """
    chunks = []
    while text:
        if len(text) <= max_chunk_size:
            chunks.append(text)
            break
            
        # Look for punctuation within the last 50 characters of the max chunk size
        chunk_end = max_chunk_size
        punctuation_marks = '.,:;।!?'
        
        # Search backward from max_chunk_size for punctuation
        found_punct = False
        for i in range(chunk_end, max(chunk_end - 50, 0), -1):
            if i < len(text) and text[i] in punctuation_marks:
                chunk_end = i + 1  # Include the punctuation mark
                found_punct = True
                break
        
        # If no punctuation found, look for space
        if not found_punct:
            for i in range(chunk_end, max(chunk_end - 50, 0), -1):
                if i < len(text) and text[i].isspace():
                    chunk_end = i
                    break
            # If no space found, force break at max_chunk_size
            if not found_punct and chunk_end == max_chunk_size:
                chunk_end = max_chunk_size
        
        # Add chunk and remove it from original text
        chunks.append(text[:chunk_end].strip())
        text = text[chunk_end:].strip()
    
    return chunks
```
</CodeGroup>

## Handling numbers


### Order IDs and Large Numbers

When handling order IDs or large numbers:
- Send them as separate requests
- Split the text around the number

**Example:**
```
Original: "Your order id is 123456789012345"
Split into:
1. "Your order id is"
2. "123456789012345"
```

### Phone Numbers

#### Default Grouping
- Numbers are automatically grouped in 3-4-3 format
- Example: "9876543210" is read as "987-6543-210"

#### Custom Formatting
For specific reading patterns:
- Format numbers explicitly in text
- Write out the exact pronunciation desired

**Example:**
```
✅ Correct: "double nine triple eight double seven double six" (for 9988877766)
❌ Incorrect: "9988877766" (if you want it read as "double nine...")
```

## Date and Time Formatting Guidelines

### Date Formats
You may use any of the following formats when writing dates:

1. DD/MM/YYYY → `12/02/2025` → "twelve, two, twenty twenty-five"
2. DD-MM-YYYY → `12-02-2025` → "twelve, two, twenty twenty-five"
3. DD Month YYYY → `12 February 2025` → "twelve February twenty twenty five"
4. Month DD YYYY → `February 12th 2025` → "February, twelfth, twenty twenty-five"
5. DD-MM-YY → `12-02-25` → "twelve, two, twenty-five"
6. DD/MM/YY → `12/02/25` → "twelve, two, twenty-five"

> Note: Ordinal suffixes (st, nd, rd, th) could be used in dates.

```
