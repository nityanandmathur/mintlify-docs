This example provides scripts and tools to perform standalone audio generation and build Livekit voice assistants using the Smallest AI TTS plugin. Follow the steps below to set up and run the experiments.

## Code Examples Repository

You can find the code examples for this setup in the following GitHub repository:

[Livekit Example Code Repository](https://github.com/smallest-inc/waves-examples/tree/main/lightning/livekit_example)

## Common Steps

### 1. Create a Virtual Environment

To ensure your Python environment is isolated, create a virtual environment:

```bash
python3 -m venv venv
```

Activate the virtual environment:

- On Linux/Mac:
  ```bash
  source venv/bin/activate
  ```

- On Windows:
  ```bash
  venv\Scripts\activate
  ```

### 2. Install Requirements

Once the virtual environment is activated, install the required dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. Sign in and Create a New Project on Livekit

Sign in here: [Livekit Cloud](https://cloud.livekit.io)

After signing in, create a new project and copy the following tokens:

```bash
LIVEKIT_API_KEY
LIVEKIT_API_SECRET
LIVEKIT_URL
```

### 4. Create a `.env` File

Create a `.env` file in the project root directory. This file should contain the following keys with appropriate values:

```bash
LIVEKIT_API_KEY=...
LIVEKIT_API_SECRET=...
LIVEKIT_URL=...
OPENAI_API_KEY=...
DEEPGRAM_API_KEY=...
SMALLEST_API_KEY=...
```

### 5. Install the Plugin

To set up the Livekit plugin for [smallest.ai](https://smallest.ai), run the following commands:

```bash
chmod +x install_plugin.sh
./install_plugin.sh
```

## Usage

### 1. Running `generate_audio.py`

To generate audio using the Smallest AI plugin as a WAV file, run the following command:

```bash
python3 generate_audio.py
```

You can change the parameters in the script and try out different voices, languages, and texts.

### 2. Running `minimal_assistant.py`

To build a minimal Livekit voice assistant using the Smallest model, run the following command:

```bash
python3 minimal_assistant.py dev
```

### 3. Connect to the Agent Here

You can connect to the agent by visiting the following link:
